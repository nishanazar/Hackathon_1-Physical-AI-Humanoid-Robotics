# Contracts for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

This directory typically contains API contracts (e.g., OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas) for software projects. However, this feature (`001-robotics-book-outline`) is focused on the *layout and content plan* for a book on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, not on developing a software system with external APIs.

Therefore, no traditional API contracts will be generated or stored here. The "contracts" for this project are implicitly defined by the book's content structure, learning objectives, and the reproducibility of its code examples and simulation instructions.
