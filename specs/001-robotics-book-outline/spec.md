### P1: Custom Homepage Content

As a book author,
I want a custom homepage for my Docusaurus site
so that it effectively introduces my book "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — A Complete Guide" to visitors.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The homepage displays the title: "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — A Complete Guide".
- The homepage displays a compelling subtitle.
- The homepage includes a short introduction to the book.
- The homepage highlights the four key modules:
  1. ROS 2 (Robotic Nervous System)
  2. Gazebo & Unity (Digital Twin Simulation)
  3. NVIDIA Isaac (AI Robot Brain)
  4. Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
- The homepage has a primary button labeled "Start Reading" that links to the book's introduction.
- The homepage has a secondary button labeled "View Syllabus" that links to the book's syllabus/table of contents.
- The homepage design is clean and replaces any default Docusaurus placeholders.
