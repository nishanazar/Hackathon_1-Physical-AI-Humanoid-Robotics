# Book on AI-Native Software Development Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Content Creation
All chapters must follow Spec-Kit Plus requirements for structure, content, and acceptance criteria.

### II. Technical Accuracy
All technical information, code examples, and factual claims must be verified against authoritative sources. Sources must be cited using APA style.

### III. Clarity and Accessibility
Writing must be clear, concise, and targeted at an audience of developers and technical students. Avoid jargon where possible and explain complex concepts simply.

### IV. Consistency
A consistent tone, voice, and structure must be maintained across all chapters to ensure a cohesive reading experience.

### V. Reproducibility
All instructions, code examples, and setup procedures must be reproducible by the reader. Tool versions (e.g., Docusaurus, Node.js) must be specified.

### VI. AI-Generated Content Review
All AI-generated text, code, or other content must be rigorously reviewed and verified for accuracy, correctness, and absence of hallucinations.
