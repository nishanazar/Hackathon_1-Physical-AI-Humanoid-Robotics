# Humanoid Unity Project Placeholder

This directory is a placeholder for a Unity project that would contain assets and scenes for high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction with a humanoid robot.

**To set up a full Unity project:**

1.  **Install Unity Hub and Unity Editor**: Download the latest LTS (Long Term Support) release of Unity from the [Unity website](https://unity.com/).
2.  **Create a New 3D Project**: Start a new project in Unity Hub and save it to this `humanoid_unity_project` directory.
3.  **Import necessary packages**: Follow the instructions for integrating ROS-Unity packages (e.g., `ROS-TCP-Connector`) as described in the book's Module 2.
4.  **Import 3D models and assets**: Add your humanoid robot's 3D model and any other environment assets.

This directory will eventually contain the full Unity project structure (Assets/, ProjectSettings/, etc.) once it's initialized with Unity.
