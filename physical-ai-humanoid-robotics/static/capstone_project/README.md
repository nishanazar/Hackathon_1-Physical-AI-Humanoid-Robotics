# Capstone Project Placeholder: Autonomous Humanoid Robot with Natural Language Control

This directory is a placeholder for the Capstone Project, which demonstrates an autonomous humanoid robot performing multi-step tasks from natural language commands.

**To develop a full Capstone Project:**

1.  **Integrate all previous modules**: Combine the knowledge and examples from Module 1 (ROS 2), Module 2 (Simulation), Module 3 (Perception & Navigation), and Module 4 (Language & Control).
2.  **Define Multi-step Tasks**: Design a set of complex, multi-step tasks that the humanoid robot should be able to perform (e.g., "Go to the living room, pick up the red ball, and bring it to me").
3.  **Implement Cognitive Architecture**: Develop the full cognitive planning pipeline, including NLU (using LLMs/Whisper), task planning, action grounding to ROS 2 actions, and robust execution monitoring.
4.  **Create Simulated Environment**: Set up a comprehensive simulation environment (in Gazebo or Isaac Sim) with the humanoid robot and all necessary objects and landmarks.
5.  **Test and Verify**: Thoroughly test the system in simulation, verifying that the robot can correctly interpret and execute natural language commands.
6.  **Real-world Deployment (Optional)**: If hardware is available, deploy the system to a physical humanoid robot for real-world validation.

This directory will eventually contain all the necessary code, configuration files, and assets for the Capstone Project.
