# Isaac Sim Synthetic Data Generation Project Placeholder

This directory is a placeholder for an NVIDIA Isaac Sim project focused on synthetic data generation for humanoid robots.

**To set up a full Isaac Sim project for synthetic data generation:**

1.  **Install NVIDIA Omniverse Launcher and Isaac Sim**: Follow the official NVIDIA documentation to install these tools.
2.  **Create a New Isaac Sim Project**: Within Isaac Sim, create a new project and save it to this `synthetic_data_gen` directory.
3.  **Develop Scene and Robot Assets**: Create or import your humanoid robot model and define the simulation environment.
4.  **Implement Synthetic Data Generation Scripts**: Write Python scripts using the Isaac Sim API to randomize scene parameters, attach sensors, and capture various types of ground truth data (e.g., RGB, depth, bounding boxes, segmentation masks).

This directory will eventually contain the full Isaac Sim project structure, including scene files, scripts, and generated datasets.
