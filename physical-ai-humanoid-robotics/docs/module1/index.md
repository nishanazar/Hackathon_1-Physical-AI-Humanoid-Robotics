# Module 1: Mastering Robot Control with ROS 2

This module provides a comprehensive introduction to the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the middleware of choice for modern robotics applications.

## ROS 2 as Middleware

ROS 2 is not an operating system in the traditional sense, but rather a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. It provides services like hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management.

### Key Concepts in ROS 2

- **Nodes**: A node is an executable that uses ROS 2 to communicate with other nodes.
- **Topics**: A topic is a named bus over which nodes exchange messages.
- **Services**: A service is a request/response communication pattern.
- **Actions**: An action is a long-running, feedback-driven goal.
