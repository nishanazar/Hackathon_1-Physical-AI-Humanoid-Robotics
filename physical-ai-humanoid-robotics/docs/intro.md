# Introduction

Welcome to the exciting world of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics! This book will guide you through the fundamental concepts, tools, and techniques required to bring intelligent robots to life.

## Overview of Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence

Physical AI is a field of artificial intelligence that aims to create intelligent agents that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world. Embodied intelligence is the idea that intelligence is not just about processing information, but also about interacting with the environment through a physical body.

## The Importance of Bridging Digital AI and Physical Robots

The convergence of digital AI and physical robotics is paving the way for a new generation of robots that are more capable, flexible, and autonomous than ever before. By combining the power of deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing with advanced robotics hardware, we can create robots that can learn from their experiences, adapt to new situations, and collaborate with humans in a variety of tasks.

## The Capstone Goal

The capstone goal of this book is to guide you through the process of building and programming a humanoid robot that can perform a variety of tasks, from simple navigation to complex manipulation and human-robot interaction.

## Hardware and Software Overview

Throughout this book, we will be using a variety of hardware and software tools, including:

- **ROS 2**: The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible framework for writing robot software.
- **Gazebo**: A powerful 3D robotics simulator that allows you to test your robot's algorithms in a virtual environment.
- **Unity**: A popular game engine that can be used for high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction.
- **NVIDIA Isaac**: A robotics platform that provides a suite of tools for simulation, navigation, and manipulation.
- **Jetson Kits**: A series of single-board computers from NVIDIA that are ideal for running AI and robotics workloads on the edge.
